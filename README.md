=========

A PHP wrapper for the WikiMedia API centralized around querying Wikipedia articles 

There are many php classes, indeed complete frameworks, dedicated to the WikiMedia
API. But none of them are easy to implement, are accessible to those just learning
PHP, or focus on simply querying data from Wikipedia.  The goal of the wikidrain 
project is to develop a production-quality PHP library dedicated to easy, simple, 
and efficient querying of Wikipedia articles.
